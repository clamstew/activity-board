# Github Activity Board

**What does it do?**

A utility for viewing the activity of multiple github repo's master branch, so you can see multiple repo's codebases coming together.

While initially intended for monitoring the final projects of [@makersquare](http://github.com/makersquare) come togther, it has some interesting applications such as monitoring commits in multiple projects you contribute to or monitoring repos for a company.
